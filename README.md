# Empty_42School_Project

This repository is an empty project for [42School](https://42.fr/) Project. It has some useful things ready to use for any 42project:

 - Ready to use unitest for your project;
 - Makefile rules to debug with `lldb`, `sanitize` or `leaks`;
 - Makefile to check leaks;
 - Refresh makefile files list with [Sublime 42 tools](https://github.com/GlaceCoding/sublime-42-tools#in-action-);
 - [Deployment script](https://github.com/GlaceCoding/deploy) to make a rendered project for Moulinette & defense (this script will ignore all the file that you add in your `.vogignore`, that should be all debug and test file) `sh ./hooks/deploy` (You will find an explanation below).

**Example of rendered project generated by the deployment script:** [git@github.com:GlaceCoding/Empty_42School_Project_vogsphere.git](https://github.com/GlaceCoding/Empty_42School_Project_vogsphere)


**Goal of the deployment script:** Have on repository for github and vogsphere (intra 42), and be able to push with only one command.
